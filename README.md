## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Media queries

### What I learned
 I learnt how to use the mix-blend property on CSS:
 .card-img{
        height: 100%;
        object-fit: cover;
        mix-blend-mode: multiply;
        opacity: 90%;
        display: block;
      }
.img-frame{
    background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0;
}


### Continued development
I struggle with media queries and i would like to perfect them in future projects.
